        <h2>JavaScript Front-end Shortcode Engine</h2>
        <p>Shortcodes.js is a completely front-end solution that uses sequences of DOM elements for templating dynamic and beautiful layouts while preserving SEO where backend development is limited, e.g. Shopify.</p>

        <h1>1. Prepare</h1>
        <p>Initializing is straightforward, load the shortcodes.js script together with jQuery as the only dependencie. Create a new Shortcodes object, which will be used to register the templates and initialize the rendering.</p>

        <h1>2. Ready</h1>
        <p>Write and style your templates in HTML/CSS and register your shortcodes with binding descriptors which will provide the script with enough data on how to interpret the DOM sequences and bind the data to the template.</p>

        <h1>3. Stack</h1>
        <p>It's super simple for the end user. Just add any of the registered shortcodes as a simple text before a sequence of content and voil√° - shortcodes.js will build an amazing layout out of "thin air". It's just like magic.</p>

        <h2>Task</h2>
        <p><strong>Creating beatuiful, if needed complex, layouts</strong> in simple enviroments like Shopify or Tumblr, from WYSIWYG editor output only. All that on front-end without creating a thirdparty hosted app, while also making it easy for the end user.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>Shortcodes are a popular way to insert data or layouts provided by third party plugins in Wordpress from it's PHP based back-end. Why would you need those on the front-end?</p>
        <blockquote>First of all, why not?</blockquote>
        <p>Second of all, if you have a limited back-end but you can store JS in your theme - like for instance Shopify, where you would usualy need a thirdparty plugin to manage metadata and it's data is usualy stored elsewhere to display layouts. Why not leverage the Shopify's cache and use the data from it's product/page/article content to fill the layouts? Or on Tumblr? Why not?</p>
        <blockquote>This whole page is built with shortcode.js, with no backend at all. Give the editor on the side a try, or see how the shortcodes are declared by clicking <strong>"Show Code"</strong> on each of it's layout sections.</blockquote>
        <p>Save on back-end rendering resources and let the overpowered visitor clients do all the work, while having better SEO and easier maintainance. It's even easy for the content maintainers - content is easily exported and imported, since it's local, without any additional fuss. It's even easier and more straightforward then custom Gutenberg or Elementor modules.</p>
